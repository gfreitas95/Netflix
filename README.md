# Netflix

My initial idea with this project was just practice with the Netflix layout, but i kept evolving and I really like the way that the app was looking. I want to improve him with the API in the future to really dive in the all comcept of what is he able to do. For now, i hope you enjoy what i'm acomplish already.
